# 👋 Hi, I'm Aymane

🎓 Computer Engineering student (Génie Informatique – ENSA)  
💻 Full-Stack Developer with a growing focus on DevOps & Cloud

## 🧠 About Me

I design and build full-stack applications with clean architecture, clear separation of concerns, and production-oriented workflows.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Backend architecture & APIs
- Containerization and CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud deployment and automation

I enjoy turning ideas into **deployable systems**, not just code that runs locally.
